# Operate and Collect

Operate and Collect is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline workflow and improve data accuracy, provides a secure and reliable way to manage business operational data.

The solution comprises three parts:
1. Operate'n'Collect, a **Canvas Power App** business application that helps users manage revenue, cash-flow, business growth, profitability, and control costs, leading to more informed and timely decision-making.
2. **SharePoint Online** (site and several lists on the site) serves as a cloud-based database layer for operational data.
3. **Power BI report** is an analytics tool that provides businesses with valuable insights into their daily operations.

**The solution can be customized to meet the unique needs of each business**, feel free to contact us at contact@a3cloud.org

## Technologies 
Operate and Collect solution was built using the following technologies:

* SharePoint Online
* PowerBI 

## Initial deployment

_An appropriate administrative role is required for the initial deployment. This particular role should be defined within the organization's case, whether it is a Global Administrator, Application Administrator, or another role that allows for such deployment within the tenant._

To fully install the Operate and Collect solution, you need to deploy and configure the application together with the database layer. Based on user experience feedback, we recommend creating a SharePoint Online site and SharePoint lists within it as the first step. Here is a PowerShell script prepared for this purpose.  
You can also deploy and configure the SharePoint lists according to the data layer description placed in the SharePoint online folder of the repository. Alternatively, you can connect to another data source with the same model structure for your deployment. Once the data layer is settled, you can import the application as a managed PowerPlatform solution and easily configure connections with data. The analytical report also works with the data structure from the data source, so it can be deployed as the last step of the initial process. Note that the initial deployment could be carried out separately for each part of the solution.
